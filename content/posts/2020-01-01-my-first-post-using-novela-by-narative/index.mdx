Hi! Thanks so much for visiting! I am a software engineer who likes
to read and write and make art and stuff. Lately, I have been playing around 
with some tools and techniques that allow me to combine these hobbies.  
Some of these experiments have yielded some pretty cool results so I made this
blog to share them with the world.

With the exception of those signed by me, all of the articles that appear on 
this blog will be written 100% by machines, and will be posted without alteration.
They have been composed by a few different neural networks and at some-point I will
write more in-depth explanations of what exactly is going on and how they work.
But for now, I hope you enjoy the all the beautiful, uncanny weirdness as much
as I do.

xoxo,

Ben Reilly
